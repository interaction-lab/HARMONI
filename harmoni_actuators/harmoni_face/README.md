# HARMONI Face

Harmoni provides a wrapper on the cordial face, which is capable of expressing speech and emotion.

We provide a fork of the face of [CoRDial](https://github.com/ndennler/cordial-public) which was created by the Interaction Lab. Although it started as one face, we have implemented separate services for the eyes and mouth, allowing them to be controlled independently.
