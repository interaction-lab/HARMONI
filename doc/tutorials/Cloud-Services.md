# Connecting to Cloud Services

## Setup Amazon Accounts
(If you are planning to use Lex or Polly) Set up AWS account following these steps: 

Create an Amazon Web Services account. AWS has a 1 year free trial that includes a limited number of Polly usages.
Keep this in mind so you do not get charged money at the end of the year.

Once you've created an account, create an IAM user to access Polly and/or Lex.

    * Give the IAM user access permissions to AWS Polly and/or Lex.
    * Give the IAM user access keys. Be sure to save the secret key as you only have one chance to look at it.

Then, in the terminal,
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install awscli
$ aws --version
$ aws configure
# Enter the IAM user access and secret keys here.
```

## Setup Google Accounts
If you are planning on using dialogflow or other google services:

You need to update private-keys.json in ./dockerfiles/config/ with your google credentials.
When you activate google account API, you can create credentials for connecting HARMONI with your account, following this instraction.
Get the API key (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/get-api-key)
You must have at least one API key associated with your project.

To get an API key:

* Go to the Google Cloud Platform Console.
* Click the project drop-down and select or create the project for which you want to add an API key.
* Click the menu button and select APIs & Services > Credentials.
* On the Credentials page, click + Create Credentials > Create ID client OAuth.
* Click Service Account, fill the input text with your name. Set the role to Editor, and click end.
* Click the menu button and select APIs & Services > Credentials. In the Service Account table (at the bottom of the page) the account you just created will be displayed. Click on edit. Click on add new keys, and save it.
* Click Close.
* The new API key is listed on the Credentials page under API Keys.
(Remember to restrict the API key before using it in production.)
* Save private-keys.json

Set credentials on HARMONI:

```bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/HARMONI/dockerfiles/config/
$ nano private-keys.json
# Copy and paste the json content generated in the previous steps.
```

Note: Secret keys and configurations are done locally and mounted to images through the Docker-Compose.yml files
