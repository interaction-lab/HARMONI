# Working with Cordial Face
We provide an implementation of a face from the [cordial package](https://github.com/ndennler/cordial-public) implemented by the Interaction Lab. Although it is started as one face, we have implemented separate services for the eyes and mouth, allowing them to be controlled independently.
