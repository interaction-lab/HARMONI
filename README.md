# HARMONI
Welcome to HARMONI (Human And Robot Modular OpeN Interactions)! HARMONI is a ROS based tool for creating and controlling human-robot interaction. HARMONI is an open source tool meant to speed up development and experimentation for the HRI community.

## Overview

Human And Robot Modular OpeN Interactions (HARMONI) is a ROS based tool for creating and controlling human-robot interaction. HARMONI is an open source tool meant to speed up development and experimentation for the HRI community. HARMONI is built on the hybrid Sense-Plan-Act architecture with a wealth of standard capabilities needed for fluent human-robot interaction built in. HARMONI has been built on ROS-Kinetic and Python3 to allow integration with existing ROS packages and tools, but will be extended to ROS2 soon. HARMONI is built in docker to allow easy setup and standard deployment across various hardware and Operating Systems.

In order to support a wide range of hardware types the core HARMONI functionality has been separated from the hardware specific functionality, using seperate repositories, with following naming convention: HARMONI-[hardware] (e.g. HARMONI-PC, HARMONI-QT, HARMONI_QUORI, etc.).

To further improve modularity, functionality in HARMONI is divided into individual modules. The modules are tightly coupled through a messaging scheme based on ROS actionlib, the details of which are described further in the harmoni_common_lib module.

## TODO
- [ ] Rearrange face detection package
- [ ] Create a changelog
